There are a variety of 3rd party apps available for GIS and surveying for [Android](gis_software_android.md), [iOS](gis_software_ios.md), and [Windows](gis_software_windows.md). We will cover a few examples below that should give you an idea of how to get the incoming NMEA data into the software of your choice.

The software options for Apple iOS are much more limited because Apple products do not support Bluetooth SPP. That's ok! The SparkFun RTK products support additional connection options including TCP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## ArcGIS Field Maps

For reasons unknown, Esri removed TCP support from Field Maps for iOS and is therefore not usable by SparkFun RTK devices at this time.

If you must use iOS, checkout [SW Maps](gis_software_ios.md/#sw-maps), [ArcGIS QuickCapture](gis_software_ios.md/#arcgis-quickcapture), or [ArcGIS Survey123](gis_software_ios.md/#arcgis-survey123).

[Field Maps for Android](gis_software_android.md/#arcgis-field-maps) is supported.

## ArcGIS QuickCapture

<figure markdown>
![ArcGIS QuickCapture splash screen](./img/QuickCapture/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture - Main Window.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

[ArcGIS QuickCapture](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcgis-quickcapture/id1451433781) is a popular offering from Esri that works well with SparkFun RTK products.

ArcGIS QuickCapture connects to the RTK device over TCP. In other words, the RTK device needs to be connected to the same WiFi network as the device running QuickCapture. Generally, this is an iPhone or iPad operating as a hotspot.

!!! note
	The iOS hotspot defaults to 5.5GHz. This must be changed to 2.4GHz. Please see [Hotspot Settings](gis_software_ios.md/#hotspot-settings).

The RTK device must use WiFi to connect to the iPhone or iPad. In the above image, the device will attempt to connect to *iPhone* (a cell phone hotspot) when WiFi is needed.

<figure markdown>
![TCP Server Enabled on port 2948](./img/ArcGIS/SparkFun RTK - ArcGIS TCP Config.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Next, the RTK device must be configured as a *TCP Server*. The default port of 2948 works well. See [TCP/UDP Menu](menu_tcp_udp.md) for more information.

<figure markdown>
![RTK device showing IP address](./img/QuickCapture/iOS/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture iOS - IP Address.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the RTK device connects to the WiFi hotspot, its IP address can be found in the [System Menu](menu_system.md). This is the number that needs to be entered into QuickCapture. You can now proceed to the QuickCapture app to set up the software connection.

<figure markdown>

[ArcGIS Survey123](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcgis-survey123/id993015031) is a popular offering from Esri that works well with SparkFun RTK products.

ArcGIS Survey123 connects to the RTK device over TCP. In other words, the RTK device needs to be connected to the same WiFi network as the device running ArcGIS. Generally, this is an iPhone or iPad.

Returning to the map view, we can now begin gathering point information with millimeter accuracy.

## Hotspot Settings

Apple released an iOS update in mid 2024 that changed the default hotspot frequency to 5.5GHz. The RTK product line uses 2.4GHz for WiFi and will not be able to communicate at this frequency. This can be fix by opening *Settings* then **Personal Hotspot**.

<figure markdown>
![iOS Hotspot settings](./img/iOS/SparkFun RTK iOS - Hotspot Settings.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Be sure to enable *Maximize Compatibility*. This will force the hotspot to use 2.4GHz.

## QField

<figure markdown>
![Opening page of QField](./img/QField/SparkFun RTK QField - Opening Page.png)
<figcaption markdown>

</figure>

[QField](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/) is a free iOS app that runs QGIS.

<figure markdown>
![Modified NMEA messages on RTK Torch](./img/QField/SparkFun RTK QField - NMEA Messages.png)
<figcaption markdown>
Modified NMEA messages on RTK Torch
</figcaption>
</figure>

First, configure the RTK device to output *only* the following NMEA messages:

- GPGGA
- GPGSA
- GPGST
- GPGSV

QField currently does not correctly parse other messages such as **GPRMC**, or **RTCM**. These messages will prevent communication if they are enabled.

These NMEA message settings can be found under the [Messages menu](menu_messages.md), using the [web config page](configure_with_wifi.md) or the [serial config interface](configure_with_serial.md).

## SW Maps

SWMaps is available for iOS [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sw-maps/id6444248083).

Make sure your RTK device is switched on and operating in Rover mode.

Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your iOS device Settings.

The RTK device will not appear in the _OTHER DEVICES_ list. That is OK.

<figure markdown>
![iOS Settings Bluetooth](./img/iOS/Screenshot1.PNG)

Open SWMaps.

Open or continue a Project if desired.

SWMaps will show your approximate location based on your iOS device's location.

<figure markdown>

Close the menu and your RTK location will be displayed on the map.

You can now use the other features of SWMaps, including the built-in NTRIP Client.

Re-open the menu and select 'NTRIP Client'.

Enter the details for your NTRIP Caster - as shown in the [SWMaps section above](#sw-maps).

<figure markdown>
![iOS SWMaps NTRIP Client](./img/iOS/Screenshot8.PNG)

## Other GIS Packages

Hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to connect the RTK product line to most any GIS software. If there is other GIS software that you'd like to see configuration information about, please open an issue on the [RTK Firmware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/issues) and we'll add it.

## What's an NTRIP Caster?

In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

## Where do I get RTK Corrections?

Be sure to see [Correction Sources](correction_sources.md).

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster or other RTCM correction source? There are a few options.

The [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000) gets corrections via an encrypted signal from geosynchronous satellites. This device gets RTK Fix without the need for a WiFi or cellular connection.

Also, you can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md).

If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station).

There are services available as well. [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. [Point One](https://app.pointonenav.com/trial?utm_source=sparkfun) also offers RTK NTRIP service with a free 14 day trial and easy to use front end.
