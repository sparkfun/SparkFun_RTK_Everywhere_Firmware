# iOS

Torch: ![Feature Supported](img/Icons/GreenDot.png)

There are a variety of 3rd party apps available for GIS and surveying for [Android](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/gis_software_android/), [iOS](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/gis_software_ios/), and [Windows](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/gis_software_windows/). We will cover a few examples below that should give you an idea of how to get the incoming NMEA data into the software of your choice.

The software options for Apple iOS are much more limited because Apple products do not support Bluetooth SPP. That's ok! The SparkFun RTK products support additional connection options including TCP and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## ArcGIS Survey123

![ArcGIS Survey123 Home Screen](<img/ArcGIS/SparkFun RTK - ArcGIS Main Screen.png>)

*ArcGIS Survey123 Home Screen*

[ArcGIS Survey123](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcgis-survey123/id993015031) is a popular offering from Esri that works well with SparkFun RTK products.

ArcGIS Survey123 connects to the RTK device over TCP. In other words, the RTK device needs to be connected to the same WiFi network as the device running ArcGIS. Generally, this is an iPhone or iPad.

![Adding WiFi network to settings](<img/ArcGIS/SparkFun RTK - ArcGIS WiFi Hotspot.png>)

*Adding WiFi network to settings*

The RTK device must use WiFi to connect to the data collector. Using a cellular hotspot or cellphone is recommended. In the above image, the device will attempt to connect to *iPhone* (a cell phone hotspot) when WiFi is needed.

![TCP Server Enabled on port 2948](<img/ArcGIS/SparkFun RTK - ArcGIS TCP Config.png>)

*TCP Server Enabled on port 2948*

Next, the RTK device must be configured as a *TCP Server*. The default port of 2948 works well. See [TCP/UDP Menu](menu_tcp_udp.md) for more information.

![RTK device showing IP address](<img/ArcGIS/SparkFun RTK - ArcGIS WiFi IP Address.png>)

*RTK device showing IP address*

Once the RTK device connects to the WiFi hotspot, its IP address can be found in the [System Menu](menu_system.md). This is the number that needs to be entered into ArcGIS Survey123. You can now proceed to the ArcGIS Survey123 app to set up the software connection.

## QField

![Opening page of QField](<img/QField/SparkFun RTK QField - Opening Page.png>)

[QField](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/) is a free iOS app that runs QGIS.

![Modified NMEA messages on RTK Torch](<img/QField/SparkFun RTK QField - NMEA Messages.png>)

*Modified NMEA messages on RTK Torch*

First, configure the RTK device to output *only* the following NMEA messages:

* GPGGA
* GPGSA
* GPGST
* GPGSV

QField currently does not correctly parse other messages such as **GPRMC**, or **RTCM**. These messages will prevent communication if they are enabled.

These NMEA message settings can be found under the [Messages menu](menu_messages.md), using the [web config page](configure_with_wifi.md) or the [serial config interface](configure_with_serial.md).

## Other GIS Packages

Hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to connect the RTK product line to most any GIS software. If there is other GIS software that you'd like to see configuration information about, please open an issue on the [RTK Firmware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/issues) and we'll add it.

## What's an NTRIP Caster? 

In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

## Where do I get RTK Corrections?

Be sure to see [Correction Sources](correction_sources.md). 

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster or other RTCM correction source? There are a few options.

The [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000) gets corrections via an encrypted signal from geosynchronous satellites. This device gets RTK Fix without the need for a WiFi or cellular connection.

Also, you can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). 

If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). 

There are services available as well. [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. [Point One](https://app.pointonenav.com/trial?utm_source=sparkfun) also offers RTK NTRIP service with a free 14 day trial and easy to use front end.
