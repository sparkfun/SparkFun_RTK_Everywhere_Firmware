While we recommend [SW Maps for Android](gis_software_android/#sw-maps), there are a variety of 3rd party apps available for GIS and surveying for [Android](gis_software_android.md), [iOS](gis_software_ios.md), and [Windows](gis_software_windows.md). We will cover a few examples below that should give you an idea of how to get the incoming NMEA data into the software of your choice.

## ArcGIS Field Maps

[ArcGIS Field Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.fieldmaps&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not have a built in NTRIP Client to allow high precision corrections down to the RTK device. To enable high-precision, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open Field Maps.

<figure markdown>
![Field Maps main menu](./img/FieldMaps/SparkFun RTK Field Maps - Main.png)

</figure>

Field Maps will use the device's internal location as its default location provider. With GNSS Master or Lefebure providing the mock location to the phone, Field Maps will have a super precise GNSS location and data collection can begin.

## ArcGIS QuickCapture

[ArcGIS QuickCapture](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.arcgisquickcapture&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not allow Bluetooth connections to 3rd party RTK devices. To enable a connection to a SparkFun RTK device, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open QuickCapture.

## ArcGIS Survey123

[ArcGIS Survey123](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.survey123&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not allow Bluetooth connections to 3rd party RTK devices. To enable a connection to a SparkFun RTK device, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open Survey123.

<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click 'DONE'.

What's an NTRIP Caster? In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Checkout [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). If you'd just like a service, [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. Remember, you can always use a 2nd RTK device in *Base* mode to provide RTCM correction data but it will be less accurate than a fixed position caster.

<figure markdown>
![Selecting data source](./img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%2011.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Click 'My NTRIP1' then 'Done' and 'Connect'.

Now you can begin using the SparkFun RTK device with Field Genius.

## GNSS Master

[GNSS Master](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnssmaster&hl=en_US) is a great utility when a given GIS app does not have an NTRIP Client or a way to connect over Bluetooth. GNSS Master connects to a RTK device over Bluetooth (or Bluetooth BLE) as well as any correction source (NTRIP, PointPerfect, even USB Serial), and then acts as the phone's location using [Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

!!! note
	Most GIS apps will not need GNSS Master or Mock Location enabled and this section can be skipped.

Read how to [Enable Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

<figure markdown>
![GNSS Master main menu](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Main.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

From the GNSS Master main screen, select **GNSS Receiver Connection**.

<figure markdown>
![GNSS Receiver Selection](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Receiver Selection.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Pick the RTK device to connect to from the list, then click *Connect*. The **Data Rate** should increase indicating data flowing from the RTK device to the GNSS Master app. Click the back button to return to the main screen.

<figure markdown>
![Correction Input](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Input.png)
<figcaption markdown>

Select **Correction Input** to setup an NTRIP Client.

<figure markdown>
![Corrections List](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Source List.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

This is one of the powerful features of GNSS Master - multiple connections can be entered. This is helpful if you regularly switch between locations or NTRIP Casters and your GIS software only allows entry of a single NTRIP source. GNSS Master supports corrections from NTRIP Casters but also PointPerfect and a direct serial connection to a GNSS receiver. This can be really helpful in advanced setups.

<figure markdown>
![NTRIP Client information](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - NTRIP Client Input.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Enter your NTRIP Client information then click **SAVE**.

<figure markdown>
![Data from Caster](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Source Data Flowing.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Once connected the *Data Rate* should increase above 0 bytes per second. Return to the home screen by hitting the back button.

<figure markdown>
![Enable Mock Location](./img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Mock Location.png)
<figcaption markdown>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Enable mock location. If GNSS Master throws an error, re-enable GNSS Master as your [Mock Location provider](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) in Developer Options.

Once enabled, any GIS app that selects 'Internal' or 'Phone Location' as its source will instead be fed the high precision NMEA being generated by the RTK device connected over Bluetooth.

## Lefebure

[Lefebure NTRIP Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lefebure.ntripclient&hl=en_US) is the *original* app for getting correction from an NTRIP caster and down over Bluetooth. It's an oldie but a goodie.

!!! note
	Most GIS apps will not need Lefebure or Mock Location enabled and this section can be skipped.

The problem is that if Lefebure is connected to the RTK device providing RTCM corrections over Bluetooth, then other GIS applications cannot use the same Bluetooth connection at the same time. That's where mock locations save the day. Lefebure can be setup to take over or 'mock' the GPS location being reported by the phone. Nearly all GIS apps can use the phone's GPS location. So if the phone's location is magically super precise, then Lefebure can be the NTRIP Client and data provide, and your GIS app is none the wiser, and uses the phone's location.

Read how to [Enable Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

<figure markdown>
![LEfebure settings](./img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - Main.png)

**NTRIP Client**

!!! note
	If you are using a radio to connect Base to Rover, or if you are using the RTK Facet L-Band you do not need to set up NTRIP; the device will achieve RTK fixes and output extremely accurate location data by itself. But if L-Band corrections are not available, or you are not using a radio link, the NTRIP Client can provide corrections to this Rover.

If you selected 'DGPS' as the Model type, the RTK submenu will be shown. This is where you give the details about your NTRIP Caster such as your mount point, user name/pw, etc. For more information about creating your own NTRIP mount point please see [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md)


Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click connect. You will see bytes begin to transfer from your phone to the RTK device. Within a few seconds, the RTK device will go from ~300mm accuracy to 14mm. Pretty nifty, no?

What's an NTRIP Caster? In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). If you'd just like a service, [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. Remember, you can always use a 2nd RTK device in *Base* mode to provide RTCM correction data but it will be less accurate than a fixed position caster.

Once everything is connected up, click the Green check in the top right corner.

## SW Maps

The best mobile app that we’ve found is the powerful, free, and easy-to-use [SW Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.softwel.swmaps) by Softwel. It is compatible with Android and iOS, either phone or tablet with Bluetooth. What makes SW Maps truly powerful is its built-in NTRIP client. This is a fancy way of saying that we’ll be showing you how to get RTCM correction data over the cellular network.

Be sure your device is [paired over Bluetooth](connecting_bluetooth.md#android).

<figure markdown>
![List of BT Devices in SW Maps](./img/SWMaps/SparkFun%20RTK%20SWMaps%20Bluetooth%20Connect.png)

</figure>

From SW Map's main menu, select *Bluetooth GNSS*. This will display a list of available Bluetooth devices. Select the Rover or Base you just paired with. If you are taking height measurements (altitude) in addition to position (lat/long) be sure to enter the height of your antenna off the ground including any [ARP offsets](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/FAQ.xhtml#faq4) of your antenna (this should be printed on the side).

Click on 'CONNECT' to open a Bluetooth connection. Assuming this process takes a few seconds, you should immediately have a location fix.

You can open the GNSS Status sub-menu to view the current data.

**NTRIP Client**

If you’re using a serial radio to connect a Base to a Rover for your correction data, or if you're using the RTK Facet L-Band with built-in corrections, you can skip this part.

We need to send RTCM correction data from the phone back to the RTK device so that it can improve its fix accuracy. This is the amazing power of the SparkFun RTK products and SW Maps. Your phone can be the radio link! From the main SW Maps menu select NTRIP Client. Not there? Be sure the 'SparkFun RTK' instrument was automatically selected connecting. Disconnect and change the instrument to 'SparkFun RTK' to enable the NTRIP Connection option.

Once you have a full RTK fix you'll notice the location bubble in SW Maps turns green. Just for fun, rock your rover monopole back and forth on a fixed point. You'll see your location accurately reflected in SW Maps. Millimeter location precision is a truly staggering thing.

## Vespucci

[Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android&hl=en_US&gl=US) is an Open Street Map editor for Android.

This software requires the RTK device to connect over TCP. Be sure you have a local WiFi network entered into the [WiFi Config menu](menu_wifi.md), have a TCP Client or Server enabled, and have noted the TCP port (it's 2947 by default).

## Other GIS Packages

Hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to connect the RTK product line to most any GIS software. If there is other GIS software that you'd like to see configuration information about, please open an issue on the [RTK Firmware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/issues) and we'll add it.

## Where do I get RTK Corrections?

Be sure to see [Correction Sources](correction_sources.md).

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster or other RTCM correction source? There are a few options.

The [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000) gets corrections via an encrypted signal from geosynchronous satellites. This device gets RTK Fix without the need for a WiFi or cellular connection.

Also, you can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md).

If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station).

There are services available as well. [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. [Point One](https://app.pointonenav.com/trial?utm_source=sparkfun) also offers RTK NTRIP service with a free 14 day trial and easy to use front end.
