During browser configuration, the RTK device will present a webpage that is viewable from a desktop, laptop, or cell phone. This is available over WiFi for all devices and ethernet for some (RTK EVK only). For advanced configurations, a desktop is recommended. For quick in-field changes, a cell phone works great.

5. If connecting over WiFi, then connect to WiFi network named ‘RTK Config’. You should be automatically re-directed to the config page but if you are not, open a browser (Chrome is preferred) and type **rtk.local** into the address bar.

!!! note
	Upon connecting, your phone may warn you that this WiFi network has no internet. That's ok. Stay connected to the network and open a browser. If you still have problems turn off Mobile Data so that the phone does not default to cellular for internet connectivity and instead connects to the RTK Device.
