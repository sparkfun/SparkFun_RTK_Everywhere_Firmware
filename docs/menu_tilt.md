The Tilt Compensation menu controls how the tilt sensor is configured.

- **1** - By default, tilt compensation is enabled but can be disabled if desired.
- **2** - The pole length must be set accurately to enter tilt compensation mode. The default is 1.8 meters.

## Entering Tilt Compensation Mode

To use Tilt Compensation, the user must indicate to the IMU to begin calibration by shaking the device. Then, once the IMU has calculated its position on the end of the pole, Tilt Compensation will be active.

During Tilt Compensation, all outgoing NMEA messages are modified to output the location *of the tip of the pole*. The Data Collector software will not be aware that the position of the GNSS receiver position is being modified. Moving the tip of the pole is allowed. Tilt up to 30 degrees will introduce less than 10mm of inaccuracy. Tilt up to 60 degrees will introduce less than 20mm of inaccuracy.

If the audible beeper is enabled, a long beep will be heard when the IMU starts calibration (by shaking). A short beep will be heard when the IMU completes calibration and Tilt Compensation is active. A short beep will continue every 10 seconds to let the user know Tilt Compensation is being applied.

Tilt Compensation mode will be exited when the user short presses the power button, and a long beep will be heard. Additionally, Tilt Compensation mode will be exited if RTK Fix is lost. When this happens, the IMU will attempt to re-enter Tilt Compensation mode if RTK Fix is re-achieved.

Tilt compensation mode can be entered using the following steps:

1. The device must be in Rover mode.
2. The device must achieve an RTK Fix.
3. The pole length must be accurately configured. By default, this is 1.8 meters.
4. Once the above requirements are met, the device must be shaken. This is normally a strong up/down vertical motion. However, if it is more comfortable, the device can be positioned horizontally over the shoulder and shaken with a strong forward/backward motion.
5. On devices that support it, the device will emit a chirp once Tilt Mode is started.
6. Place the tip of the device on the ground. Move the head of the device back and forth up to ~30 degrees of tilt. Repeat on the opposite axis.
7. On devices that support it, the device will emit a long chirp once Tilt Compensation Mode is active. The device is now outputting the *location of the tip* of the pole.
8. Exit Tilt Compensation Mode by short pressing the power button.
