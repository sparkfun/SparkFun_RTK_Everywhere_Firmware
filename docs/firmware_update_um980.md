The UM980 is the GNSS receiver inside the RTK Torch. The following describes how to update the firmware on the UM980.

1. Download the latest UM980 firmware. As of writing, the UM980 firmware is [v11833](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Torch/main/UM980_Firmware/UM980_R4.10Build11833.pkg). See the [RTK Torch repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Torch) for the latest firmware.
2. Download and install [UPrecise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Torch/main/UM980_Firmware/uprecise-v2-0.exe). UPrecise is the software created by Unicore to configure and view output from Unicore GNSS modules. v2 of the software can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Torch/main/UM980_Firmware/uprecise-v2-0.exe) but newer versions may be available.

3. Put the device into passthrough mode. From the main menu navigate to System 's'->Hardware 'h'->UM980 Direct Connect '13'. This will put the device into a pass-through mode, but with special character monitoring that allows the UM980 to be reset when bootloading is detected. Close the terminal connection so that UPrecise can connect to the COM port.

	!!! note
		The RTK device will stay in this passthrough mode until the external power button is pressed and released. The device will beep when exiting passthrough mode.
