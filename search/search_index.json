I went too cheap; my tripod doesn\u2019t have a hook on the bottom so the string with a bolt (I didn\u2019t even have a plumb bob) to center above the marker was not central to the Facet. The height measurement from the mark to the ARP (bottom of the Facet) was done with a tape measure, in other words, not very accurate. But it works!</p> <p>Find the monument and locate your Facet (or RTK Surveyor, Express, Express Plus, Facet L-Band, etc) over the monument. Using a tape measure or other tool, measure the distance from the top of the monument to the bottom of the Facet. In this example, it was 45 \u00be\u201d or 1162mm. Obviously, millimeters matter here but don't let 'perfection' be the enemy of 'done'.</p> <p></p> <p>L-Band Facet ARP</p> <p>Locate the ARP of your given RTK product (53mm for units using the TOP106 Antenna, 61mm for Facet, 69mm for Facet L-Band). Add your ARP to the height above the monument you measured previously. In this example 1416 + 69 = 1.485m. Enter that total height into SW Maps as the \u2018Instrument Height\u2019. This will allow the software to subtract the antenna location height from the current 3D location to gain the location of the point where the plumb bob (or bolt) below your apparatus is located.</p> <p>With your instrument height determined, connect to the RTK product, begin sending RTCM corrections (either over NTRIP or radio link) and enter RTK Fix.</p>"},{"location":"accuracy_verification/#record-readings","title":"Record Readings","text":"<p>SW Maps screenshot of monument location</p> <p>We can see the approximate location of the monument in the above location.</p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot of a point in time</p> <p>Note the 8 decimal places on the Lat/Long. </p> <p>Screenshots are an easy way to record lat/long/alt but SW Maps (and other GIS software) allows the averaging of a position.

This is a collection of base stations located at regular intervals across a geographic area. Corrections coming from this type of network provide the highest RTK accuracy (14mm or less is common when located within 10km of a base station) with the minimum convergence time (the time you have to wait before the GNSS receiver can achieve RTK Fix). Normal convergence time for an OSR is a few seconds. However, because a CORS has to be placed every few 10km, these type of networks are expensive to install and maintain. An OSR network is prone to holes or gaps in the network where a base station is not sufficiently close to maintain RTK Fix.

There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.</p> <p>Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Checkout Creating a Permanent Base. If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board.

In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.</p> <p>Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out Creating a Permanent Base. If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board.

Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.</p>"},{"location":"gis_software_windows/#where-do-i-get-rtk-corrections","title":"Where do I get RTK Corrections?","text":"<p>Be sure to see Correction Sources. </p> <p>Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster or other RTCM correction source?

The Base doesn't move and 'knows' where it is so it can calculate the discrepancies between the signals it is receiving and what it should be receiving. Said differently, the 'Base' is told where it is, and that it's not moving. If the GPS signals say otherwise, the Base knows there was a disturbance in the Force ionosphere. These differences are the correction values passed to the Rover so that the Rover can have millimeter-level accuracy.</p> <p>There are two types of bases: Surveyed and Fixed. A surveyed base is often a temporary base set up in the field. Called a 'Survey-In', this is less accurate but requires only 60 seconds to complete. The 'Fixed' base is much more accurate but the precise location at which the antenna is located must be known. A fixed base is often a structure with an antenna bolted to the side. Raw satellite signals are gathered for a few hours and then processed using Precision Point Position. We have a variety of tutorials that go into depth on these subjects but all you need to know is that the RTK Facet supports both Survey-In and Fixed Base techniques.</p> <p>Please see the following tutorials for more information:</p> What is GPS RTK?

The radio transmits in the ISM band from 902 to 928MHz and is legal to use in North America and South America. The radio implements frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) techniques as well as LoRa modulation to maximize transmission distance while switching frequencies to abide by FCC requirements.
