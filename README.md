The [SparkFun RTK Torch](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25662) is a centimeter-level GNSS receiver. With RTK enabled, these devices can output your location with 8mm horizontal and vertical [*accuracy*](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/accuracy_verification/) at up to 20Hz. It supports Galileo E6 HAS and has built-in tilt compensation too!

The [SparkFun RTK EVK](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24342) is the perfect development platform for your fixed or mobile high-precision positioning and navigation needs. We called it the EVK (Evaluation Kit) as it truly covers all the options: L1 + L2 RTK GNSS, with L-Band correction built-in. Regarding connectivity, the SparkFun RTK EVK has it all: WiFi / BluetoothÂ®, Ethernet and LTE cellular!

The [SparkFun RTK Postcard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/26916) is a scalable DIY RTK device capable of running the RTK Everywhere Firmware. The LG290P RTK module lives at the heart of the RTK Postcard providing 10mm accuracy and L1/L2/L5 reception. Add the [Portability Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-portability-shield.html) to add a display, battery charging and logging.

This repo houses the [RTK Product Manual](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware) and the firmware that runs on the SparkFun RTK product line including:

* [SparkFun RTK Torch](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/25662)
* [SparkFun RTK EVK](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24342)

Documentation
--------------

* **[RTK Everywhere Product Manual](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/)** - A detailed guide describing all the various software features of the RTK product line. Essentially it is a manual for the firmware in this repository.

Repository Contents
-------------------

* **/Firmware** - Source code for SparkFun RTK Everywhere Firmware as well as various feature unit tests
* **/Graphics** - Original bitmap icons for the display
* **/docs** - Markdown pages for the [RTK Product Manual](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/)

Repository Branch Structure
---------------------------

This repository has two long-term branches: `main` and `release_candidate`.

With respect to the firmware, `main` is a branch where only changes that are appropriate for all users are applied. Thus, following `main` means updating to normal releases, and perhaps bugfixes to those releases.

In contrast, `release_candidate` is where new code is added as it is developed.

The documentation source code is in docs/ on `main`. It is built automatically on push and stored in the branch `gh-pages`, from which it is served at the above URL. Documentation changes are pushed directly to main.

Release Process
---------------

A release is made by merging `release_candidate` back to `main`, and then applying a tag to that commit on `main`.

A pre-release is often created using the latest stable release candidate. These binaries will have extra debug statements turned on that will not be present in a formal release, but should not affect behavior of the firmware.

Building from Source
--------------------

For building the firmware, see the [Firmware README](Firmware/readme.md). For compiled binaries of the firmware, please see [SparkFun RTK Everywhere Firmware Binaries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware_Binaries).

For the documentation, see [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) and [/workflows/mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/blob/main/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml).

For building the Uploader_GUI see [SparkFun_RTK_Firmware_Uploader](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware_Uploader). The pyinstaller executables are generated by the [/workflows](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware_Uploader/tree/main/.github/workflows)

For building the u-blox_Update_GUI see [u-blox_Update_GUI](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware_Binaries/tree/main/u-blox_Update_GUI) and the header comments of [RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/blob/main/u-blox_Update_GUI/RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py)
