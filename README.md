Repository Branch Structure
---------------------------

This repository has two long-term branches: `main` and `release_candidate`.

With respect to the firmware, `main` is a branch where only changes that are appropriate for all users are applied. Thus, following `main` means updating to normal releases, and perhaps bugfixes to those releases.

In contrast, `release_candidate` is where new code is added as it is developed.

The documentation source code is in docs/ on `main`.  It is built automatically on push and stored in the branch `gh-pages`, from which it is served at the above URL. Documentation changes are pushed directly to main.

Release Process
---------------

A release is made by merging `release_candidate` back to `main`, and then applying a tag to that commit on `main`.

A pre-release is often created using the latest stable release candidate. These binaries will have extra debug statements turned on that will not be present in a formal release, but should not affect behavior of the firmware.

Building from Source
--------------------

For building the firmware, see the [Firmware README](Firmware/readme.md).

For the documentation, see [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) and [/workflows/mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml).

For building the Uploader_GUI see the header comments of [RTK_Firkware_Uploader_GUI.py](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/Uploader_GUI/RTK_Firmware_Uploader_GUI.py)

For building the u-blox_Update_GUI see the header comments of [RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/u-blox_Update_GUI/RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py)
